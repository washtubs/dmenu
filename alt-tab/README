Dmenu: Alt-tab mode
===================

The provided shell script and dmenu modifications allow for an alt-tab UX similar to windows
except entirely scriptable.

The alt-tab script expects 2 parameters, an input script to feed options and a reply script to
process the user's selection.

    ./alt-tab.sh ./sample_in.sh ./sample_reply.sh

This should be bound to Alt+Tab through your window manager

In the same vein as other suckless utilities, this script is intended to be modified to your
liking, not necessarily installed vanilla.

Inner workings
--------------

The shell script is intended to handle a potentially long running input script that may end after
the user has already hit Tab multiple times. We don't start dmenu until the input is completely
recieved, so we track tab presses inside the shell script.

The initial execution will grab an exclusive lock in /tmp/alt-tab (or $ALT_TAB_MUTEX if provided),
and execute the input script.

Subsequent executions will fail to grab the lock and instead increment the value in /tmp/alt-tab/advance
which uses a separate exclusive lock.

Once the initial execution completes it will grab the value from /tmp/alt-tab/advance
and use that to start dmenu pre-advanced, so none of the user's tab presses are lost.
